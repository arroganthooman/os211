# Top 10 List of Week 09

1. [Mass Storage
Management](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/Mass-Storage-Management#:~:text=Each%20modern%20disk%20contains%20concentric,a%20read%2Fwrite%20desk%20available.)<br>
Disks are the mainly used mass storage devices. They provide the bulk
of secondary storage in operating systems today. The management is
divided into two parts, disk structure and disc scheduling.  In disk
scheduling, there are some algorithm to perform scheduling as they
have been discussed in last week materials.

2. [What is non-volatile
storage](https://techterms.com/definition/non-volatile_memory)<br>
Nonvolatile storage is physical media that retains data without
electrical power. This means that no data is lost when the computer is
powered off, example: hard disks. This thing makes hard disks suitable
for permanent storage of information

3. [What is NAND Flash
memory?](https://www.delkin.com/blog/what-is-nand-flash-memory/)
NAND flash memory is the data storage format that is often found in
solid state drives (SSDs), embedded memory cards, and USB devices.
Everytime i looked in computer things shop, i found NAND Flash and now
i know what is a nand flash from this article.

4. [What is BIOS?](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/BIOS-basic-input-output-system)<br>
BIOS (basic input/output system) is the program a computer's
microprocessor uses to start the computer system after it is powered
on. It also manages data flow between the computer's operating system
(OS) and attached devices, such as the hard disk, video adapter,
keyboard, mouse and printer. It's 2021 and i just knew what BIOS
stands for.

5. [What is UEFI?](http://boron.physics.metu.edu.tr/ozdogan/OperatingSystems/week5/node23.html)<br>
A standard programming interface for booting a computer. Governed by
the UEFI Forum (www.uefi.org), it evolved from the EFI interface
developed by Intel, first used in its Itanium line. UEFI is software
based so it resides in a folder in flash memory on the motherboard,
storage drive or network drive.

6. [UEFI vs BIOS](https://www.howtogeek.com/56958/htg-explains-how-uefi-will-replace-the-bios/)<br>
What i can say is UEFI is a modern BIOS. Created to replace the BIOS
system. UEFI can handle anything BIOS can and more than it. Example:
UEFI enables users to handle drives that are larger than 2 TB, while
the old legacy BIOS couldn't handle large storage drives.

7. [What is GRUB?](https://itsfoss.com/what-is-grub/)<br>
GRUB is a complete program for loading and managing the boot process.
It is the most common bootloader for Linux distributions. A bootloader
is the first software that runs when a computer starts.

8. [What is RAID?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/raid-redundant-arrays-of-independent-disks/)<br>
RAID is a technique which makes use of a combination of multiple disks
instead of using a single disk for increased performance, data
redundancy or both. There are 4 key evaluation points of RAID system,
reliability, availability, performance, capacity.

9. [Network-Attached
Storage](https://www.seagate.com/as/en/tech-insights/what-is-nas-master-ti/)<br>
An NAS device is a storage device connected to a network that allows
storage and retrieval of data from a central location for authorised
network users and varied clients. Some benefits of NAS system are
simple to operate, lower cost and easy data backup, good at
centralising data storage in a safe and reliable way.

10. [SCAN algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scan-elevator-disk-scheduling-algorithms/)<br>
SCAN or sometimes called Elevator algorithm is one of disk scheduling
algorithm in operating system. In many source i read, they said that
this algorithm is better than FCFS. But this algorithm is also has a
disadvantages, one of them is if you use SCAN, then more complex
algorithm has to be implemented.
